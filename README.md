## How can I add content?

As a contributor to the Android Dev Notes website, you can add content related to Android/Kotlin in different sections, including Apps, Libraries, Tools, Tutorials, and Insights. Here are some guidelines to help you add content to the website:

Explore the website and see which section you can add content to. You are free to create new directories or files inside the sections to better organize content.

Take a look at `.mdx` files on GitHub in 'docs' directory. You can use the same format to add content to the website for the sections.

### Apps section

In the Apps section, you can add open source apps that you have found useful and think others will find useful too.

Example: Found an okay app with modern architecture and want to share it with others? Add it to the Apps section.

Format: The format for title is flexible. However, usually it is: `App Name - Short intro`. For example, `Palov - A Recipe App in Jetpack Compose`.

### Libraries section

In the Libraries section, you can add libraries that you have found useful and think others will find useful too.

Example: Found a new library for image processing and want to share it with others? Add it to the Libraries section.

### Tools section

In the Tools section, you can add tools that you have found useful and think others will find useful too.

Example: Found a tool that can boost productivity in Android Studio and want to share it with others? Add it to the Tools section.

### Tutorials section

In the Tutorials section, you can add tutorials that you have found useful or write your own tutorials that you think others will find useful too.

Example: Found a tutorial that is simply interesting and want to share it with others? Add it to the Tutorials section.

### Insights section

In the Insights section, you can add any other useful information related to Android, such as website links, discussions, tips and tricks, or news about Android releases or deprecations.

Example: Found out something's going to be released soon or getting deprecated about Android and want to share it with others? Add it to the Insights section.

All above examples are just for reference. You can add whatever sane content to any section that you think is useful.

By following these guidelines, you can contribute to the Android community by sharing useful information and resources with others.
