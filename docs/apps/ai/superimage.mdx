# SuperImage - a neural network based image upscaling Android app (AI)

## Overview

SuperImage is an Android application that utilizes a neural network and the MNN deep learning framework to perform image upscaling. The application incorporates Real-ESRGAN technology, which enhances the quality of the upscaled images by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. With SuperImage, users can easily sharpen low-resolution pictures and produce high-quality images with improved visual details.
