# Tools - Introduction

Tools section is place of all the tools that can help along the way of Android development.

## How can I add content to the Tools section?

In the Tools section, you can add tools that you have found useful and think others will find useful too.

Example: Found a tool that can boost productivity in Android Studio and want to share it with others? Add it to the Tools section.
