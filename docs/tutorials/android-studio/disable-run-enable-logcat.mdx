# Better Launch Setup - Disable Run and Enable Logcat in Android Studio

## Overview

When launching app by clicking on the green play button, Android Studio will open the Run window and run the app. Not so useful, considering the information provided in the Run window. Instead, it is better to disable the Run window and enable the Logcat window to open when launching app. Logcat window provides more useful information for debugging.
