# Better Launch Setup - Disable Run and Enable Logcat in Android Studio

## Overview

When launching app by clicking on the green play button, Android Studio will open the Run window and run the app. Not so useful, considering the information provided in the Run window. Instead, it is better to disable the Run window and enable the Logcat window to open when launching app. Logcat window provides more useful information for debugging.

## Steps

1. Open Edit Configurations window by clicking the dropdown button (near Android Head icon) with "app" selected.
2. Scroll down, and uncheck the "Activate tool window" checkbox.
3. Go to Miscellaneous tab, and check the "Show logcat automatically" checkbox and "Clear log before launch" checkbox. (Optional)
4. Done. Run the apo and notice the Run window is not opened, and Logcat window is opened instead.

## Summary

Useful setup as it will save the effort of closing the Run window and opening the Logcat window every time you launch the app.
