# Android Nuggets - Part 1

Makes you think or wonder.

## Hilt was originally called Cloak

The dependency injection library Hilt which is Google's recommended solution for DI in Android was originally called Cloak!

This comment was in relation to the post on `/r/RedditEng` regarding [Refactoring our Dependency Injection using Anvil](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/10vla9g/refactoring_our_dependency_injection_using_anvil/)

**Discussion on Reddit:**

> Project Cloak was our internal project to evaluate and leverage Anvil

Ironic name choice given that Hilt was originally supposed to be called Cloak. You have to get brand approval for your open source project name at Google and they rejected it because of the negative connotations. They also suggested renaming Dagger.
