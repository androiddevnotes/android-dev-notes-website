# Flashlight - Measure performance of your Android app

## Overview

Flashlight helps measure performance of the Android app. It is self-hosted, open source, and can be used with any Android app. It is inspired by Lighthouse, a tool for measuring performance of web apps.

Flashlight can be integrated with Maestro, Appium and other tools for UI testing.

  ```
  When it's running, open the app on your device, interact with it, when you're done, press `w` in the terminal to write the results to a file.
