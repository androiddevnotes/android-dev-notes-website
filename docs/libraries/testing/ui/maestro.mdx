# Maestro - UI Testing Framework for Android, iOS, and Web

## Overview

Maestro is a mobile UI automation testing library that leverages learnings from Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, and XCTest, and provides a declarative syntax for defining and testing Flows, which are key parts of the user journey in mobile apps, such as Login, Checkout, and Add to Cart.

Flows are defined in .yaml files. They are simple to write and read.
